## Your first "Hello Words" in C++ 
 
Let's start our journey into C++ with something simple. 
Let's write a program that will say "Hello World!"

In C++, the entry point to the program is a distinguished function named `main`. 
Your task is to add code to this function so that it will print the string "Hello World!"

To print something in C++, one can use the following syntax:

```c++
std::cout << "Text to be printed";
```
